  # Defines the root path route ("/")

end
# Changing the resources :posts line in the routes.rb file to the nested namespace structure namespace :api do ... end with namespace :v1 do ... end is a common practice when building an API in Rails. This modification helps to organize and version your API endpoints.

#   Here's what the modified code does:
  
#   namespace :api do ... end: This sets up a namespace called "api" to group your API-related routes separately from other routes in your application. This helps maintain a clear separation between your API endpoints and other application routes.
  
#   namespace :v1 do ... end: Within the "api" namespace, this creates a nested namespace called "v1". The "v1" namespace denotes the version of your API. By versioning your API, you ensure that changes to the API in the future won't break existing client applications that depend on a specific version.
  
#   resources :posts: Inside the "v1" namespace, this sets up the RESTful routes for the "posts" resource. It generates standard CRUD routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
  
#   By structuring your routes this way, you achieve a more organized and versioned API structure. For example, your posts-related endpoints would now be accessible via /api/v1/posts. This can be particularly useful when you plan to make changes or introduce new features to your API while maintaining backward compatibility with existing client applications.
  
#   By nesting your routes within namespaces, you can also apply specific middleware, authentication, or authorization filters to the entire namespace or individual routes. This allows for more fine-grained control over the behavior and security of your API endpoints.
  
#   It's important to note that using versioned namespaces for your API is not a strict requirement, and it depends on your specific use case. If you don't anticipate the need for future breaking changes or you have a small and simple API, you may choose to skip the versioning and use the resources :posts line directly.
  
#   Consider the scalability, maintainability, and potential backward compatibility requirements of your API when deciding whether to implement versioned namespaces in your routes.
